Duration: ~3.67 minutes
Voiceover: Professional Male Voiceover (AI-generated)

How I Created It:
Scriptwriting:
I wrote a personalized script summarizing our full AI course — covering both theoretical topics like search algorithms, reasoning, NLP, and robotics, and practical lab work including Minimax, Alpha-Beta, and game implementations.

Using InVideo:
I used the AI Text-to-Video tool in InVideo to generate a professional video with automated visuals and voiceover narration.

Visual Enhancements:
I added visuals for:

Search trees (BFS, DFS, IDS, A*)
Games (Tic Tac Toe, Chess, Connect Four)
Graphs (Precision, Recall)
NLP workflows
Real-world robotics examples
Export:
The video was finalized and exported as AI_Course_Video.mp4.
