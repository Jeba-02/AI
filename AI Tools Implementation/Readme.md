🧠 AI Tools Implementation
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of various AI tools to create a complete multimedia output — including both a video and a presentation.
It highlights how different AI-powered platforms can work together to streamline content creation, from ideation to visual presentation.

🎬 Project Workflow

Prompt Generation (AI Assistance)

AI was used to generate creative prompts, scripts, and ideas for the video and slides.

These prompts served as the foundation for both the storytelling and design phases.

Video Creation using Steve.ai

The AI-generated script was used in Steve.ai to automatically produce a professional animated video.

Steve.ai handled scene selection, character animation, and voiceover, showcasing how AI simplifies video production.

Presentation Design using Canva AI

Canva’s AI tools (such as Magic Design and Text to Presentation) were used to generate presentation slides.

The slides visually summarize the video’s key ideas and demonstrate AI-assisted design automation.

🎥 AI Tools Implementation
📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how different AI tools can be integrated into a single creative workflow.
The main objective is to show the end-to-end use of AI — from idea generation to content creation and presentation design.

🧠 Project Concept

The process began by generating a creative prompt and script using AI, which served as the foundation for both the video and presentation.
By combining the power of Steve.ai and Canva AI, the project illustrates how artificial intelligence can streamline multimedia content creation.

⚙️ Workflow
1. Prompt Generation (AI Assistance)

The project starts with a prompt generated using an AI model (e.g., ChatGPT).

The AI provided the script idea, narrative flow, and content tone for the video and presentation.

2. Video Creation using Steve.ai

The AI-generated script was used in Steve.ai to automatically create a video.

Steve.ai handled:

Scene selection

Character animation

Voiceover narration

Background visuals

The result is a fully AI-produced educational video.

3. Presentation Design using Canva AI

Canva’s AI tools (e.g., Magic Write, Magic Design) were used to transform the same script into a professional presentation.

Canva AI automatically generated layouts, visuals, and text formatting to match the video’s theme.
