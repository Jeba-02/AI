🧠 AI Research Agent

A modular, automated AI Research Agent built using Python, integrated tools, and the Google API for advanced internet-augmented research.

This agent takes a user prompt, performs structured research using Google Search capabilities, processes the results through custom tools, and generates a final research summary (stored in research_output.txt).

This project demonstrates how AI, automation, and real-time web search can be combined to create a fully functioning research assistant.

🧠 Overview

This AI agent acts as an automated research tool.  
You provide a topic → the agent uses the Google Search API → fetches real-time data → processes the information → generates a structured research output.

The system is built to be:

- Modular  
- Extensible  
- Easy to configure  
- Able to integrate new tools  
- Capable of generating high-quality research summaries  

All outputs are saved into research_output.txt for later use.

🔧 How This Agent Was Built

You followed the workflow below to build the project:

1. Created the Python project folder  
   Containing:  
   - main.py  
   - tools.py  
   - research_output.txt  
   - requirements.txt  
   - .env

2. Installed required Python libraries  
   Your requirements.txt includes all dependencies needed to run the agent, including API integration and environment variable management.

3. Added Google Search API Integration  
   You used a Google API key (stored in .env) to allow your agent to perform real-time searches.  
   This enables the agent to gather fresh, accurate, and current information.

4. Built Custom Tools (tools.py)  
   You wrote helper functions that the AI agent can call:  
   - A tool for performing Google searches  
   - A tool for saving research output  
   - Utility helpers used inside the agent  
   These tools allow the AI model to take action, not just generate text.

5. Built the Main Agent (main.py)  
   This is the core program that:  
   - Loads your API keys  
   - Accepts user input (research topic)  
   - Uses tools to fetch information  
   - Sends tool results to the AI model  
   - Generates final research summaries  
   - Saves them to research_output.txt

6. Saved Final Outputs  
   Every time the agent runs, it creates or updates:  
   - research_output.txt  
   This allows you to keep a history of previous research sessions.

🚀 Features

✔ Automated research  
Uses the Google API to fetch real-time information.

✔ Tool-driven architecture  
The agent can call custom tools to perform tasks.

✔ Stores research results  
Automatically writes summaries into research_output.txt.

✔ Fully modular  
You can add more tools or models easily.

✔ Clean project structure  
Built to be reusable for various AI automation tasks.

🧰 Technology Used

Component              Purpose  
Python 3               Core language  
Google API Key         Real-time search capability  
dotenv                 Loads environment variables  
Custom Tool System     Allows the agent to execute actions

🔑 Google API Key Usage

Your .env file contains:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here  
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_search_engine_id

The agent uses these to:

- Perform live Google searches  
- Return structured JSON data  
- Supply real, up-to-date information to the AI model  

This ensures the agent’s research is accurate, reliable, and current.

⚙️ Installation

1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git  
cd your-repo
2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


3️⃣ Set up .env
Create a .env file:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key  
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_search_engine_id


⚙️ Configuration (.env)
Your .env file controls:
- API keys
- Model settings
- Search engine ID
- Any other future configuration variables
Example:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=123abc456def  
MODEL=gpt-5.1


🔍 How It Works
- User enters a research topic
- Agent loads API keys
- Agent uses Google API to fetch search results
- Tools process the raw data
- The AI model analyzes and interprets the data
- A structured research summary is generated
- The output is saved into research_output.txt
- The summary is displayed in the terminal
- The summary is displayed in the terminal
▶️ Running the Agent
Run:
python main.py


Then enter your topic:
Enter your research topic: Quantum Computing Applications


The agent will:
- Search Google
- Process results
- Generate a structured research summary
- Save it automatically
📝 Example Workflow
You enter:
"Research how AI agents work and provide an overview."
The agent:
- Fetches relevant search results
- Extracts key insights
- Writes a structured summary
Output saved in:
research_output.txt
🧩 Adding Your Own Tools
You can extend the system by adding new tools to tools.py.
Examples include:
- PDF generator
- Webpage scraper
- File uploader
- Email notifier
Then register the new tool in main.py.
